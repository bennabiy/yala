#
# Attribute Descriptions
# 
# $attr_desc is an associative array (hash) containing a list of values 
# (key) and their description
# (value). It'll be available to the user in some ways, i.e. <ACRONYM> 
# HTML Tag.
#
# Note: by default, the attribute descriptions are taken from the schema,
#       so there's no real reason to put anything here.
#
# Note 2: attribute names must be lowercase!

# General
#$attr_desc["cn"] = "Common Name";

# User objects
$attr_desc["gecos"]		= "User's full name (aka GECOS field), i.e. John Smith";
