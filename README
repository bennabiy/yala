YALA (Yet Another LDAP Administrator)
-------------------------------------

WHAT IS YALA?

YALA is a web-based LDAP administration GUI. The goal is to simplify 
the directory administration with a graphical interface and neat 
features, though to stay a simple, general-purpose directory manager.

A secondary goal is not to make the YALA user stupid: to achieve this,
we try to show the user what YALA does behind the scenes, what it sends
to the server (unlike MS Active Directory, for example), and use the
original LDAP terms.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES

- Clear and Simple interface.
- Cross-Platform: YALA can be accessed from any platform using any modern 
  browser, and the server-side should work on most OSes & Web Servers.
- Advanced JavaScript for smoother user experience (AJAX)
- Standard. In theory YALA supports any LDAP server.
  See REQUIREMENTS section for list of supported servers.
- Uber schema reader pro (tm): YALA reads the schema remotely from the LDAP
  server.
- Entry Types recognition: You can configure YALA to recognize an entry of
  objectclasses X & Y, for example, as a user entry, have a special icon for 
  it, and allow simple creation of new entries of this type (i.e. add a new 
  user). 
- Security: Supports LDAP over TLS (Transport Layer Security) if your LDAP 
  server supports it.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS

Server Side:
- PHP5 with LDAP support. depends how you got your PHP installed:
  * Using the native PHP on your favorite Linux distro (recommended):
    - Debian/Ubuntu: apt-get install php5-ldap
    - CentOS/RedHat: yum install php-ldap

  * Installing from source: enable LDAP support in compile time: 
    i.e., "./configure --help | grep -i ldap"

  Note that you'll need LDAP libraries installed on your system.
  apt-get or yum would take care of it automagically.


- In theory, YALA should work on ANY platform under ANY web-server
  that supports PHP. It is known to work well on:
  Linux   + Apache
  Solaris + Apache
  (Mail me if you're using it with another combination)

- Any (either local or remote) standard LDAP Server. YALA is known to work 
  well with:
  OpenLDAP
  Fedora Directory Server
  Microsoft Active Directory
  Oracle Internet Directory (OID)
  OpenDS
  (Again, let me know if you have something to add here)
  

Client Side:
- The only requirement is a modern web browser, for Cookies & JavaScript
  support.

  PNG support is recommended. Any modern browser should support it.
