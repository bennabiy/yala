  configuration is now more modular and was made so next versions you could
  still use your current configurations.

  (config.inc.php must be upgraded for that reason as well)

  Thanks to Claudio Thomas for pointing that out

  0.20 was a bad release (well, even linux had 2.4.11...)

  bug report.

Version 0.12 (18/04/2003)
-------------------------
- We do NOT require 'register_globals = on' in php.ini anymore. This solves
  the 'unable to login' problem which was reported by many people.

- The code doesn't check if the icon exist for each icon, but creates a list
  of icons in advance and increases the efficiency.

- config.inc.php has a new define(), DEFAULT_ICON: please synchronize it
  with your older configuration.
