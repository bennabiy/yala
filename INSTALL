.Installing YALA.
-----------------
Installation instructions:
(1) Untar the package into somewhere accessible by your web server
(2) Create a config.inc.php from the sample file config.inc.php.example, then
edit it as you wish..
(3) You might want to do the same for the files under the conf.d/ directory.

YALA files can (read: must) be read-only for the web server, it only needs
write access to the CACHE_PATH (defined in config.inc.php) directory.

We assume you already have a web server working and configured with php
support.

For help in installing php on your web server, please refer to php.net.


.Upgrading YALA.
----------------
While upgrading don't forget to read the ChangeLog. You'll probably want to
keep using your old configuration file, but there might've been changes in this
file in the new version. Such changes will be reported in the ChangeLog.
